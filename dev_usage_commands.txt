In GOReverseLookup -> Terminal: poetry build

C:\Aljosa\Development\Environments\goreverselookup_test\Scripts\activate.bat

pip install C:\Aljosa\Development\GOReverseLookup\dist\goreverselookup-1.0.XX.tar.gz (if building from a local poetry build)
NOTE: replace XX with current version
or
pip install goreverselookup

IMPORTANT! If you are developing, run 'pip install -e .', to install goreverselookup in editable mode.
    This links goreverselookup directly to your programming environment, and changes made in the programming environment
    directly take effect in the goreverselookup module.

    When running from CMD, activate the virtual environment from the .venv located in VSCode's working environment
    to work with the latest goreverselookup developer instance (without having to re-install goreverselookup again and again
    to a custom virtual environment)

cd C:\Aljosa\Development\Environments\goreverselookup_test

goreverselookup C:\Aljosa\Development\Environments\goreverselookup_test\test-model\input-test.txt

goreverselookup "C:\Aljosa\Development\Environments\goreverselookup_test\test-model\input-chronic-inflammation.txt"
