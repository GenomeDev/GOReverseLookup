# JNK cascade:  evidence indicates that this Janus signaling promotes cancer cell survival. JNK acts synergistically with NF-ÎºB, JAK/STAT, and other signaling molecules to exert a survival function (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/med.21574#:~:text=c%2DJun%20N%2Dterminal%20kinase,to%20exert%20a%20survival%20function)

# Wnt cascade; # ... leading to actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. In addition, Dvl activates Rac and finally JNK (c-Jun-N-terminal-kinase) thereby modulating cell migration. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5853106/; doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2015.12.005)
